Stupid simple scripts for automaticaly scale applications hosted in a Cloudfoundry PaaS


### Requiremts
- Ruby 2.1.5 +
- Apache Benchmark (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html)
- Some CF based PaaS public/private provider with full access to the Cloud Controller API

### Set up

#### Clone the repo
```
git clone <this repo CLONE URL >
cd cf-auto-scaling
bundle
```

#### Set up credentials and application details
```
cp config/config.yml.template config/config.yml
```
Replace values in config.yml to fit your context. 

Also you can use following environment variables to configure autoscaler: `CF_API`, `CF_USERNAME`, `CF_PASSWORD`, `CF_ORGANIZATION`, `CF_SPACE`, `CF_APPLICATION`

#### Push demo app
I've created a simple sinatra app that generate secure random number which require CPU (I am very new at this. 
Sorry for my ignorance)
> You need to be targeted and logged in into a CF PaaS

```
cd cd sinatra-test-app/
cf push
```


### Auto-Scaling script
Just run 
```
bundle exec ./bin/auto_scale.rb
```
This script runs forever. Just CTR + C it when you are done

### Throw load to the app
Lets make 5000 requests with 20 requests at a time
```
ab -n 5000 -c 20 http://sinatra-manu.<paas app domain>/
```

### Whatch it working
First output
```
Cloudfoundry target: https://api.....
Authenticating with user: <your username defined in config/config.yml>
Fetching first space...
Got space: development

Fetching first app from space development ...
Got app: sinatra-manu (sinatra-manu....)

CPU threshold: 70%
------------------
App sinatra-manu stats:
-- Instances: 1
-- AVG CPU load: 0.00 %
-- AVG Memory: 25.91 MB
```

When requests are hitting harder, lets suppose your instane is running out of CPU power, you'll get something
like this
```
App sinatra-manu stats:
-- Instances: 1
-- AVG CPU load: 100.00 %
-- AVG Memory: 25.91 MB

------------> AVG CPU Load went over threshold (70 %), scaling app by 1 instance
Scaling successful. Lets wait a moment for the new instance to start..

Update successful
App sinatra-manu stats:
-- Instances: 2
-- AVG CPU load: 50.00 %
-- AVG Memory: 25.90 MB

------------> AVG CPU Load went over threshold (70 %), scaling app by 1 instance
Scaling successful. Lets wait a moment for the new instance to start..

App sinatra-manu stats:
-- Instances: 3
-- AVG CPU load: 33.00 %
-- AVG Memory: 24.32 MB

App sinatra-manu stats:
-- Instances: 3
-- AVG CPU load: 33.00 %
-- AVG Memory: 25.79 MB


App sinatra-manu stats:
-- Instances: 3
-- AVG CPU load: 0.00 %
-- AVG Memory: 25.61 MB
```

#### Deploy autoscaler as an application to Cloud Foundry

Aditionaly you can run autoscaler application within Cloud Foundry. In order to do it just copy `manifest.yml.template` to `manifest.yml`, fill in necessary info and run `cf push`. It's easy!
